# Tips and tricks:
- _Sieve of Eratosthenes_ is used to filter out non-prime numbers.
- _Euclid's algorithm_ is used to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
- Use ```number & 1``` to check if the number is odd.
- Modular arithmetic operations are faster than normal operations like, ```left shift```, ```right shift```, ```XOR``` etc.
- Use ```number >> 1``` to shift one-bit towards right. This is equivalent to ```number = number / 2``` but faster than divide operator.
